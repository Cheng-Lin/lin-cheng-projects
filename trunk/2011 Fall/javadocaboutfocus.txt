protected boolean requestFocus(boolean temporary)

Requests that this Component get the input focus, and that this Component's 
top-level ancestor become the focused Window. This component must be 
displayable, focusable, visible and all of its ancestors (with the exception 
of the top-level Window) must be visible for the request to be granted. 
Every effort will be made to honor the request; however, in some cases 
it may be impossible to do so. Developers must never assume that this 
component is the focus owner until this component receives a FOCUS_GAINED 
event. If this request is denied because this component's top-level window 
cannot become the focused window, the request will be remembered and will 
be granted when the window is later focused by the user.

This method returns a boolean value. If false is returned, the request is 
guaranteed to fail. If true is returned, the request will succeed unless 
it is vetoed, or an extraordinary event, such as disposal of the component's 
peer, occurs before the request can be granted by the native windowing 
system. Again, while a return value of true indicates that the request is 
likely to succeed, developers must never assume that this component is the 
focus owner until this component receives a FOCUS_GAINED event.

This method cannot be used to set the focus owner to no component at all. 
Use KeyboardFocusManager.clearGlobalFocusOwner instead.

Because the focus behavior of this method is platform-dependent, developers 
are strongly encouraged to use requestFocusInWindow when possible.

Every effort will be made to ensure that FocusEvents generated as a result 
of this request will have the specified temporary value. However, because 
specifying an arbitrary temporary state may not be implementable on all 
native windowing systems, correct behavior for this method can be guaranteed 
only for lightweight Components. This method is not intended for general 
use, but exists instead as a hook for lightweight component libraries, 
such as Swing.

Note: Not all focus transfers result from invoking this method. As such, a
 component may receive focus without this or any of the other requestFocus
  methods of Component being invoked.

Parameters:
    temporary - true if the focus change is temporary, such as when the 
    window loses the focus; for more information on temporary focus changes 
    see the Focus Specification
Returns:
    false if the focus change request is guaranteed to fail; true if it is 
    likely to succeed

    1.4
